# LinkedIn-Scraper-Playwright
## Tool to scrape linkedin using playwrite  
\
&nbsp;
Testing with Playwrite to see what it can do. This scraper is slow, but hopefully shouldn't trigger any abuse systems. Let it run for a bit, work on something else and it should hopefully be ready.
This only grabs the top 100 pages from linkedin. Results dependent on who you're connected with.

**Be aware, this is a test run script, it will crash**
